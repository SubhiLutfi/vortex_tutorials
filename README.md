# vortex_tutorials

This is a repository to contains tutorial assignments for Vortex Projects (github.com/vortexgpgpu/vortex). 

We provide assignment 1&2 template codes to provide the assignment 1 & 2. 
The rest of the assignments are referring to the assignment1&2 code. Although the code is very similar to vortex code, since 
vortex project is actively evolving, we suggest looking at both the provide code and the main code. Line numbers are referring to the provided template code version. 

[assignment1.md] and [assignment2.md] are adding simple hardware performance counters. 
[assignment3.md] and [assignment4.md] are adding hardware prefetcher. 
[assignment5.md] is adding software prefetching.
